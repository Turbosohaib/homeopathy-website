                                    While homeopathy was developed over 200 years ago, modern
                                    scientific research continues to explore its mechanisms of
                                    action and clinical effectiveness. This page examines the

                                            Research by Dr. Jayesh Bellare and his team at the Indian

                                            extremely high dilutions where conventional chemistry
                                            would suggest no molecules remain. These nanoparticles may
                                            be created during the succussion (vigorous shaking)
                                            process and could explain biological activity.

                                            are harmful. This well-documented principle in

                                            scientific evidence for homeopathy, as it eliminates the

                                            The scientific understanding of homeopathy continues to
                                            evolve. While there are still unanswered questions about
                                            exactly how homeopathy works, the growing body of research
                                            suggests that the effects of homeopathic remedies cannot
                                            be dismissed as merely placebo.

                                            we may develop a more complete scientific explanation for

                                            the clinical evidence for homeopathy&apos;s effectiveness
                                            in certain conditions provides a practical basis for its
